# Vigilant-Guardian-A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Enhance-Driver-Alertness-on-the-Road

Driver fatigue is a leading cause of accidents, making real-time drowsiness detection critical for road safety. This project developed a driver drowsiness detection system using deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By analyzing facial cues like eye blinks and yawning, the system provided real-time alerts to mitigate risks associated with drowsy driving.
